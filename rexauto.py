rexauto — one shot: Xbox 360 content container -> a recompiled build that boots.

Drop in a container (or an extracted game folder) and it runs the whole pipeline
that otherwise takes a day of by-hand steps:

  1. extract      container -> game folder (default.xex + assets)
  2. init         scaffold a ReXGlue project
  3. jumptables   (if IDA present) recover bctr jump tables -> switch_tables.toml
  4. build+heal   codegen + build; auto-extend any function the recompiler split
                  mid-flow until the build is clean (boundary heal)
  5. run+heal     run; register every "invalid/unregistered function" the
                  dispatcher hits, rebuild, repeat until it stops hitting them
  6. run          launch it

What it does NOT do: fix game-specific GPU/emulation gaps (a title whose vertex
formats or kernel calls the runtime doesn't support yet will boot and run but may
not render or stay up). That is runtime work, not recompilation. rexauto gets you
to a booting, guest-code-executing build automatically; the rest is per title.

    python rexauto.py "<container-or-folder>" --name mygame [--run]

Re-run any time: each stage is skipped if already done. --from <stage> restarts
from a point, --only <stage> runs one. Tool paths come from their usual install
locations, PATH, or the env vars REXGLUE / REXSDK_DIR / IDAT / CLANG / CLANGXX /
VCVARS / JT_REPO.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------- timings
# Nothing in this pipeline ever recorded a duration. `time` appeared only as a
# DEADLINE -- do_build's 0.3s progress throttle, run_once's launch window -- and
# not one subtraction was ever stored, so "the IDA pass dominates" and "the heal
# loop is the expensive part" were folklore: unfalsifiable, and by the loop
# charter's own rule (optimizing an unmeasured stage is forbidden) they blocked
# every speed change behind them. This is that instrument. It only ADDS: one new
# top-level state key, one new sidecar file, and stamps that are all no-ops under
# REXAUTO_TIMINGS=0.
#
# WHY IT IS A STACK and not a wrapper around main()'s stage loop:
#   stage_build -> setup_extra_modules -> _codegen_module runs a companion
#   module's ENTIRE IDA pipeline (stage_jumptables + stage_deepextract + two
#   codegens) inside the `build` stage, and stage_runheal re-enters the whole of
#   stage_build on companion auto-detect. A flat timer bills fifadllzf's serial
#   IDA minutes to "clang" and lets the re-entrant build's stamp land on top of
#   the real one. Every frame therefore reports wall_s (inclusive) AND self_s
#   (exclusive of its children), and carries phase/module/depth so two `build`
#   rows are two rows instead of one overwriting the other.
#
# WHY A SKIPPED STAGE IS NOT 0.0s:
#   a zero that means "we never ran it" is a fabricated measurement, and it would
#   poison exactly the comparison the ledger exists for -- a warm re-run would
#   look like a pipeline that got 8x faster. Checkpoint skips record status only,
#   with no wall_s key at all.
#
# WHY EVERY STAMP IS SWALLOWED:
#   the instrument may never be the reason a stage fails. Every sink write, every
#   note and every roll-up is inside try/except, exactly as load_state() already
#   swallows its own reader errors.

# --- SDK compatibility pin --------------------------------------------------

# the runtime ABI, exactly the kind of mismatch this guards against. rexauto
# refuses to run against an SDK whose binaries don't match the ones it was built
# and tested with. No override: every port rexauto has ever shown correct was
# built on these exact binaries. Bump these when the bundled SDK is updated.
#
# Where the binaries come from: branch `rexauto` of github.com/xdzleo/rexglue-sdk
# -- upstream main plus every fix below as its own branch (each one an open
# upstream PR), merged. Its tree is byte-identical to the source these were
# built from, so anyone can rebuild the bundled SDK from that branch.
# The release this source belongs to. The GUI's Setup fetches the SDK of THIS
# tag, never "latest": a newer release's SDK would fail this build's pin.

    # they land:
    #
    #   * xam_content: XamContentCreate captured a std::string_view over GUEST
    #     memory into the lambda it hands to CompleteOverlappedDeferredEx. By the
    #     time the dispatch thread ran it the title had reused the buffer, and the
    #     stale bytes reached utf8 iteration -> utf8::invalid_utf8 -> FATAL ->
    #     0xC0000409. Gears of War Judgment died at 13s, three runs of three; 108s
    #     clean with the fix. We already fixed this once, in 2.6.0, in a fork we
    #     never upstreamed -- which is exactly how v0.10.0 shipped it back to us.
    #   * codegen: resolve a call/branch target from the graph when the per-site
    #     CallTarget table has no entry, instead of emitting REX_FATAL. 39 sites on
    #     Judgment, 28 of them conditional back-edges into registered functions.
    #     39 holes -> 0.
    #   * codegen: an out-of-range jump-table index dispatches instead of
    #     __builtin_trap(). The trap lowers to ud2, so it killed the process with
    #     STATUS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION and nothing in the log -- 5s into Judgment, at
    #     one of 121 such defaults. The hot path is unchanged: the same switch at
    #     -O2 gives a byte-identical dispatch prologue either way.
    #   * codegen: [[image_patch]], byte patches applied to the decoded image
    #     before analysis. This is what makes the community patch catalogues usable
    #     in a static recompiler at all -- see gamepatches.py.
    #
    # Verified no recompilation regression against the 0.8.2 baseline on Judgment:
    # 99.2073% of code bytes vs 99.1979%, 60,146 functions vs 60,137, 0 holes in
    # both, and identical numbers before and after the clang-format pass that the
    # upstream CI requires.
    #
    # rexgpu-xenos.dll is pinned as well now: v0.10.0 moved the GPU out into a
    # plugin, so an SDK whose runtime matches but whose plugin does not renders
    # nothing while reporting only "gpu_plugin not set; call ignored".
    # v2.35.2: rebuilt with two more runtime fixes -- the InputSystem device-table
    # race that killed Gears of War Judgment between 48s and 160s of gameplay
    # (rexglue/rexglue-sdk#432), and last-chance crash diagnostics so the next one
    # leaves a symbolisable backtrace instead of an empty log.
    # v2.36: rebuilt with four more fixes, every one proven on Forza Horizon
    # (dead at 3s in v2.35.2 -> gameplay):
    #   * codegen: a bdz/bdnz whose target is a discovered function is a tail
    #     call, not a `goto` into a label that never exists (the build could not
    #     converge on sub_82AA6270 whatever the config said).
    #   * codegen: a jump-table case whose landing the graph's containing node
    #     cannot see is still an internal label of the function being emitted
    #     (embedded table data split the node; five cases lowered to REX_FATAL).
    #   * runtime: a companion loaded by bare name reaches the recompiled-module
    #     registry as \Device\Harddisk0\Partition1\X.xex, never matching the
    #     manifest's root-relative guest_path -- XMediaFacade_default.xex was
    #     recompiled and never wired.
    #   * codegen: WARN when a config override lands on a save/restore helper;
    #     the gap fill produced eight of those and 1,141 call sites lost their
    #     intrinsic (the null read in sub_8310C340).
    #   * codegen: an absorbed function is removed from the graph while call
    #     sites still hold a CallTarget pointing at its FunctionNode. Captain
    #     America read the freed node and emitted `(ctx, base);` plus
    #     `DECLARE_REX_FUNC();` -- C++ that does not compile.
    #   * kernel: answer NtQueryInformationFile(XFileXctdCompressionInformation)
    #     with "not compressed" instead of INVALID_PARAMETER. We never serve
    #     XCTD-compressed bytes (the pipeline pre-decompresses), and the error
    #     made Captain America render none of its UI.
    #   * gpu: gpu_allow_invalid_fetch_constants defaults ON. A texture fetch
    #     constant with type 0 is still bound by the real GPU; Captain America
    #     builds every Bink plane texture that way (intro and title were flat
    #     magenta) and Forza Horizon logs two thousand per run. The fork this
    #     runtime replaced shipped the same default and ran the fleet on it.
