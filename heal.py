"""
heal.py — the two auto-heal mechanisms, parameterised (no hard-coded game).

boundary heal (build-time): the recompiler sometimes splits a function where the
compiler let control fall into the next one. The generated C++ then has
`goto loc_T` with loc_T declared in a different function -> "use of undeclared
label". Fix: extend the function F that owns the goto to swallow T
(F.end = smallest function start strictly > T). Same class the Skate 3 team fixed
by hand ~3500 times. Forced by a real compile error, so no guessing.

runtime heal (run-time): the dispatcher aborts with "invalid or unregistered
function at guest address 0xADDR" when execution reaches a function the recompiler
never discovered. Fix: register 0xADDR and rebuild. The play-and-heal loop.

Both write into one `[functions]` TOML (`{ end = .. }` overrides and `{}`
registrations coexist). Functions here are pure parsing/derivation; the driver
runs the build/run cycles.

    dataSectionFunctionPointerScan, which is where this idea comes from):
      - read only OUTSIDE the code range; scanning code itself is what makes this
        noisy (whole-image: 1,878 spurious candidates, data-only: 315)
      - 4-byte aligned value, not 0 and not 0xFFFFFFFF
      - value must land inside the code range
      - the target's own first instruction must not be 0x00000000/0xFFFFFFFF
        (alignment padding, not a function)

    Plus one rule of our own, which their SDK-side version does not need: drop
    anything already emitted as a `loc_` label. Inside an existing function body
    that address is a LANDING, and registering it as a function splits the
    routine -- the failure that made Judgment die 0.7s into every launch.

    Returns (new_functions, label_hits) -- the second being {addr: owner} for
    targets that are only a `loc_` inside another function, which are entries the
    game takes the address of and must be cured as CHUNKS, never as functions."""
